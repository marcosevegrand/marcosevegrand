### 🧪 On the Workbench

> **[Custody](https://github.com/marcosevegrand/custody)** — A compliance-first distributed KV store written in Go that combines **Raft consensus** with **immutable audit trails** and **cryptographic verification**. It solves the real problem companies face: managing configuration in regulated industries without gluing together 5+ specialized tools. *Currently in development.*

### ☕ Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not at my desk, I'm usually at the **gym** or making myself a **Baileys coffee**. I've also been making an effort to read more lately, mostly non-technical books and different genres just to keep my head clear and maintain a perspective outside of engineering.
