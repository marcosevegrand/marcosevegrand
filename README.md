## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently studying Software Engineering at Minho University, I am building a strong foundation in computer science and software development. With a growing focus on DevOps, I am taking steps toward this specialization by pursuing Microsoft Azure (among others) certifications and expanding my knowledge through courses on platforms like Udemy. Passionate about designing cloud-based solutions and automating workflows to improve development processes and team collaboration.
