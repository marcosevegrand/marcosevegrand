### 🧪 On the Workbench
*Projects I’m currently building to learn how things work under the hood:*

> **[BlockMirror](https://github.com/marcosevegrand/blockmirror)** > An experimental filesystem built with **Go** and **FUSE**. I’m using **Merkle Trees** to handle data integrity, focusing on making the system "self-healing" by detecting bit-rot and keeping file versions immutable.

### ☕ Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not at my desk, I’m usually at the **gym** or making myself a **Baileys coffee**. I’ve also been making an effort to read more lately, mostly non-technical books and different genres just to keep my head clear and maintain a perspective outside of engineering.
